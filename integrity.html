<h4 id="integrity">2. Integrity</h4>
<p>By <em>integrity</em>, I mean conformity with your <a href="identity.html">identity</a> through words and deeds. The organization must walk its talk. After saying &#8220;this is who we are,&#8221; it must henceforth act in conformity with that sense of organizational self. Another way of saying this is that the organizational identity must truly be a guiding force in the organization. </p>
<p>If an organization lacks integrity, then it will be difficult to maintain a sense of identity, and the value of that identity will be diluted. </p>
<p>Of course, moral integrity is one piece of this broader, more encompassing integrity &#8211; always assuming that ethical and upright behavior is one element of the organization&#8217;s identity. </p>
