Title:  Steps in Decision-Making Conversations

Class:  list

Level:  2 - List

Seq:    9

Index:  Weber, Craig; organizational development; 

Body:

These come from [Craig Weber][craig], and are described in his book [Conversational Capacity][book] (although I originally picked them up as part of a consulting engagement with Craig). 

Think of these as steps to follow -- especially for an organizational leader -- when engaging in a potentially difficult conversation about some decision to be made, and action to be taken. 

The goals of these four steps are to optimize leadership decisions by ensuring that all valid facts and perspectives are considered, as well as to ensure that all participants feel heard.
