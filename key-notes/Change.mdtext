Body:

In order to improve a [[type of thing]], we must make some change to it. 

This will generally consist of some change to the [[type design]] of the thing.

Note that a change can be accidental and made at random (as is the case with biological evolution), or it can be made with some forethought and anticipation of the consequences (as is often the case with human design).
