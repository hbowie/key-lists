Body:

In order to determine whether a [[change]] has produced an actual [[improvement]], some form of testing must be employed. 

Such testing can be performed by measuring the performance of the starting [[type design]] and then comparing those numbers to comparable measurements from the changed design. 

In a biological environment, such testing is performed "in the field," with outcomes generally determined by increasing vs. decreasing quantities of the new type design vs. the old type design, as they compete with one another for scarce resources. 

In free markets, such testing is often performed through competition between competing type designs. 

In sports, such testing is ultimately performed on the playing field, as individuals and groups compete with each other.

In science and engineering, such testing is often performed in a lab.
