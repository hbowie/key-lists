The Four-Way Test of the things we think, say or do is a test used world-wide as a moral code for personal and business relationships.

The test is widely promoted as one of the [guiding principles][gp] of [Rotary International][ri]. 

The test is especially useful as a way of fostering trust and cooperation within groups of people and groups of organizations.
