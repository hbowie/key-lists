<p>Dan Snowden&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework">Cynefin framework</a> offers a useful guide to differing approaches that are appropriate for situations with varying degrees of certainty. </p>
<p>The Cynefin framework suggests four different approaches, starting with situations of high certainty, and proceeding to situations with progressively lower degrees of certainty. </p>
<p>People tend to get into trouble by estimating the degree of certainty in a situation to be higher than it actually is. </p>

<details>
<summary>1. Simple Situation</summary>
<p><em>aka: mechanical response</em></p>
<p>In Simple situations, the appropriate approach is to Sense, Categorize and then Respond, making use of an established best practice. </p>
<p>In other words, a mechanical or proceduralized response is most appropriate. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>2. Complicated Situation</summary>
<p>In Complicated situations, the appropriate approach is to Sense, Analyze and then Respond, making use of expert knowledge. </p>
<p>In  other words, some serious analysis is required, and the right answer cannot simply be selected from a number of predetermined choices. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>3. Complex Situation</summary>
<p>In Complex situations, the recommended approach is to Probe, Sense and then Respond, allowing new knowledge to emerge. </p>
<p>In other words,  analysis based on existing knowledge is not enough, and some experimentation is called for. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>4. Chaotic Situation</summary>
<p>In Chaotic situations, the appropriate approach is to Act, Sense and then Respond, learning and adjusting as you go. </p>
<p>In other words, something unexpected has happened, you are in crisis mode,  and there is no opportunity for analysis or experimentation &#8211; immediate action is necessary. </p>
