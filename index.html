<h2 id="key-lists">Key Lists</h2>
<p>This is a collection of lists so useful and universal as to warrant repeated reference. </p>
<p>I realized some time ago that much of the beneficial wisdom I&#8217;ve encountered over the years has come in the form of lists of one sort or another. </p>
<p>This site is my attempt to make as many of these as I can available in one place. </p>
<p>In all cases where I can identify sources other than myself, I&#8217;ve cited the original works and authors, and tried to restate the items on the list in my own words. But I also urge readers to consult the original sources for context, clarification and additional wisdom. </p>
