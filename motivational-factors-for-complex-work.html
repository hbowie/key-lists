<p>In is book <a href="https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/">Drive</a>, <a href="https://www.danpink.com/">Daniel H. Pink</a> identified three vital sources of extrinsic motivation for individuals engaged in something more complex than simple, straightforward tasks. </p>

<summary>3. Purpose</summary>
<p><em>Purpose</em> can be thought of as the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves. </p>
<p>Notice that the &#8220;something larger than ourselves&#8221; often takes the form of contributing to a <a href="group.html">group</a> in which we feel a <a href="strong-group-identity.html">strong group identity</a>. </p>
