<h3 id="the-dreyfus-model-of-skill-acquisition"> The Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition</h3>
<p>First proposed by Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus in 1980, this model suggests that people go through roughly five stages as they acquire new skills. </p>
<p>I first heard of this model from <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/better-best-practices">Dan North</a>, who first made me aware of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition">Dreyfus model</a> and some of its implications in the field of software development. </p>
<p>These can be seen as steps on the road to <a href="mastery.html">Mastery</a>. </p>
