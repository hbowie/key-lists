<h4 id="testing">9. Testing</h4>
<p>In order to determine whether a <a href="change.html">change</a> has produced an actual <a href="improvement.html">improvement</a>, some form of testing must be employed. </p>
<p>Such testing can be performed by measuring the performance of the starting <a href="type-design.html">type design</a> and then comparing those numbers to comparable measurements from the changed design. </p>
<p>In a biological environment, such testing is performed &#8220;in the field,&#8221; with outcomes generally determined by increasing vs. decreasing quantities of the new type design vs. the old type design, as they compete with one another for scarce resources. </p>
<p>In free markets, such testing is often performed through competition between competing type designs. </p>
<p>In sports, such testing is ultimately performed on the playing field, as individuals and groups compete with each other. </p>
<p>In science and engineering, such testing is often performed in a lab. </p>
