<h3 id="7-ways-to-think-like-a-21st-century-economist"> 7 Ways to Think Like a 21st Century Economist</h3>
<p><em>aka: Doughtnut Economics</em></p>
<p>These come from Kate Raworth&#8217;s book <em><a href="https://doughnuteconomics.org">Doughnut Economics</a></em>. </p>

<details>
<summary>1. Change the Goal</summary>
<p><em>aka: From GDP to the Doughnut</em></p>
<p>Traditional economics sets the goal of continually increasing Gross Domestic Product. </p>
<p>The new goal should be to maintain economic production between a floor and a ceiling, so that we produce sufficient goods and services to meet every human&#8217;s basic needs, without creating environmental degradation to the point at which we endanger a sustainable planet for ourselves and future generations. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>2. See the Big Picture</summary>
<p><em>aka: from self-contained market to an embedded economy</em></p>
<p>Our economy does not exist in isolation, but must be seen as embedded within human society and within nature; we must consider interactions and flows between traditional economic elements and elements of these bigger systems. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>3. Nurture Human Nature</summary>
<p><em>aka: from rational economic man to social adaptable humans</em></p>
<p>We are not entirely self-interested and calculating and focused solely on maximizing our own income and wealth; we are social and interdependent and quirky and creative and have fluid value systems. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>4. Get Savvy With Systems</summary>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to stop searching for the economy&#8217;s elusive control levers and start stewarding it as an ever-evolving complex system.&#8221; </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>5. Design to Distribute</summary>
<p>We need to design economies to provide more even and equitable distribution of wealth and income. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>6. Create to Regenerate</summary>
<p>Design products and services for a circular economy. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>7. Be Agnostic About Growth</summary>
<p>We need economies that make us thrive, whether or not they grow. </p>
