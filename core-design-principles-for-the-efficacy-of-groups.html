<p>I originally encountered these principles in <a href="https://thisviewoflife.com/profile/david-sloan-wilson/">David Sloan Wilson</a>'s book, <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/246844/this-view-of-life-by-david-sloan-wilson/">This View of Life</a>.</em> If you'd like another description of these principles that is freely available on the web, you can refer to this <a href="https://evolution-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Generalizing-the-Core.pdf">PDF</a> of an article originally published in the <em>Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization</em>. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom">Elinor Ostrom</a> won a Nobel Prize for her work in this area. These principles were based &#8211; not on abstract or aspirational ideas about how such groups <em>should</em> work, or reasons why they <em>could not possibly work</em> &#8211; but on actual observation of the attributes of groups that <em>actually did work</em>. </p>
<p>As soon as I read these, I recognized their significance, and the ways in which they supported and mirrored many of the principles of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile software development</a> movement, with which I was already familiar.  </p>
<p>I believe these principles to be universal and scalable to groups of any size. </p>

<p>I would offer up this definition of the sorts of groups we're talking about here: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of humans deriving perceived benefit from a shared set of resources, working towards a common goal, with some unifying identity, and with established means of interaction. </p>
</blockquote>
