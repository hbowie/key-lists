<h4 id="identity">1. Identity</h4>
<p>An organization must know who they are. This is critical in all of the following areas: </p>
<ul>
<li>Internal alignment within the existing organization; </li>
<li>Growth and sustainment of the organization through employee acquisition and retention; </li>
<li>Trust and credibility with customers; </li>
<li>Selection and teaming with suppliers and business partners. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that an organization may have an unconscious identity as well as a conscious identity. The conscious identity is frequently based on official pronouncements and intentional efforts by leadership to establish organizational direction. On the other hand, the unconscious identity &#8211; which may be much more powerful &#8211; consists of all the things that employees tell each other around the water cooler, and the messages they communicate to new employees in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, through their words and actions. </p>
