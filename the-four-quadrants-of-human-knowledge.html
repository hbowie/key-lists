<h3 id="the-four-quadrants-of-human-knowledge">3 The Four Quadrants of Human Knowledge</h3>
<img src="images/the-four-quadrants-of-human-knowledge-diagram.png" alt=""><p>It was modern American philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber">Ken Wilber</a> who had the insight that, when we look at the many perspectives that we humans can take on a topic, these perspectives can often usefully be categorized into one of four quadrants that together make up a more balanced view of reality. </p>
<p>These four quadrants can be depicted by first dividing a square vertically, with subjective views on the left, and objective ones on the right; then dividing the square horizontally, with individuals on the top, and  collectives on the bottom. These two lines then result in the formation of the following quadrants. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upper Left (abbreviated as &#8220;UL&#8221;) &#8211; Perspectives from the interior of one individual. This is reality viewed from the &#8220;I&#8221; perspective, from my <a href="subjective.html">subjective</a> view as a single individual. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower Left (abbreviated as &#8220;LL&#8221;) &#8211; Perspectives from the interior of a social collective. This is reality viewed from the &#8220;We&#8221; perspective, from the <a href="intersubjective.html">intersubjective</a> view of a group. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upper Right (abbreviated as &#8220;UR&#8221;) &#8211; Perspectives of an individual from an exterior view. This is reality viewed from an &#8220;it&#8221; perspective, from an <a href="objective.html">objective</a> view of one individual. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower Right (abbreviated as &#8220;LR&#8221;) &#8211; Perspectives from the exterior of a social collective. This is reality viewed from the &#8220;They&#8221; perspective, based on the <a href="interobjective.html">interobjective</a> view of a <a href="group.html">group</a>. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This model can be used as a handy reminder to help us understand the various relevant perspectives on a person, event or situation. </p>
